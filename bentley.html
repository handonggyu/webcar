    <h2>Bentley</h2>
<p>Bentley Motors Limited is a British manufacturer and marketer of luxury cars and SUVs—and a subsidiary
of the Volkswagen Group since 1998. Headquartered in Crewe, England, the company was founded as Bentley Motors Limited
by W. O. Bentley in 1919 in Cricklewood, North London—and became widely known for winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans
in 1924, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, and 2003. Prominent models extend from the historic sports-racing Bentley 4½ Litre and
Bentley Speed Six; the more recent Bentley R Type Continental, Bentley Turbo R, and Bentley Arnage;
to its current model line—including the Continental Flying Spur, Continental GT, Bentley Bentayga and the Mulsanne—which
are marketed worldwide, with China as its largest market as of November 2012.</p>
